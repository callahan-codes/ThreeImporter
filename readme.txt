== Description ==

Three Importer (TI) is a WordPress plugin that was built with all users in mind.

A custom ThreeJS scene can be fabricated by the user using either a block, shortcode, or custom script injection. This allows people with little-to-no coding experience
to well-seasoned developers to create beautiful, 3D websites with full control over the scene settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Why cant I see my Geometry? 
    A: 3 reasons can cause this: Camera Position, Geometry Position, Geometry Rotation. Make sure your camera isn't inside the mesh 
    by adjusting the camera or geometry x/y/z position settings. Also try rotating the object some; the Circle Geometry, for example, 
    is so thin that if viewed from the side it appears invisible.
